# `citibikenyc` â€” Dashboard for New York Bicycle Station Usage

This project is a test application. It is built on AngularJS 1.6.9 and Angular Material components.

## How to test.

### Prerequisites
You must have the following installed to get the application running:
* nodejs with npm (preferably updated) . I used npm version 4.2.0.
* Any webserver. I used Apache Tomcat version 9.0.0.M21.

### Steps
To start this application, please perform the following steps:

* Download or clone the project.
* Go to the directory where the project resides.
* Execute "npm install". This will install all the required node modules and bower components inside the project directory. If it prompts to tell the version of AngularJS to be installed, please choose AngularJS 1.6.9.
* Copy the project directory (citibikenyc) to a webserver.
* Start the webserver.
* Go to the browser and hit "http://<webserver host>:<webserver port>/citibikenyc/app/index.html"
